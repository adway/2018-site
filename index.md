Hi! I'm Adway. I'm currently a sophomore at [Saint John's High School](http://www.stjohnshigh.org/){:target="\_blank"} in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I am interested in studying economics and would like to pursue an academic career in quantitative social policy. Feel free to view my résumé [here](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target='\_blank'}.

I enjoy learning about economics, reading the news and taking pictures with my Canon Rebel T5. I currently intern at the [Town of Westborough's Economic Development Committee](http://edc.town.westborough.ma.us){:target="\_blank"}. Currently, I'm working on populating a database with all of the businesses in Westborough. I am also a contributing writer and photographer for the [Community Advocate Newspaper](https://communityadvocate.com){:target="\_blank"}. I also serve as an organizer at [Science and Us](https://scienceandus.org){:target="\_blank"}, an organization that promotes awareness about interdisciplinary STEM careers. At school, I am a member of the mock trial team, the French Club, and the [Be Like Brit Club](https://www.belikebrit.org),
