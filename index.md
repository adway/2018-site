Hi! I'm Adway. I'm currently a sophomore at Saint John's High School in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I am interested in studying economics and would like to pursue an academic career in quantitative social policy. In my free time, I like learning about new technologies, although I'm not particularly interested in engineering or computer science. Feel free to view my résumé [here](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target='_blank'}.

I enjoy learning about economics, reading the news and taking pictures with my Canon Rebel T5. I currently intern at the Town of Westborough's Economic Development Committee, and I am a contributing writer and photographer for the Community Advocate Newspaper. Finally, since I hope to pursue a career in academia, I enjoy working on various research projects in the area of social sciences. You can view them all here. I present my research at the Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair, as well as various conferences as well.
