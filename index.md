Hi! I'm Adway. I'm currently a sophomore at [Saint John's High School](http://stjohnshigh.org/){:target="_blank"} in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I am interested in studying economics and would like to pursue an academic career in quantitative social policy. In my free time, I like learning about new technologies, although I'm not particularly interested in engineering or computer science. Feel free to view my résumé [here](/assets/files/resume.pdf){:target='_blank'}.

I enjoy learning about economics, reading the news and taking pictures with my Canon Rebel T5. I currently intern at the [Town of Westborough's Economic Development Committee](http://edc.town.westborough.ma.us){:target="_blank"}, and I am a contributing writer and photographer for the [Community Advocate Newspaper](https://communityadvocate.com){:target="_blank"}. I also serve as an organizer at [Science and Us](https://scienceandus.org){:target="_blank"}, and organization that promotes awareness about interdisciplinary STEM careers. At school, I am a member of the mock trial team, the newspaper (Red & White), the French Club, and I am a peer tutor at Saint John's Gregory Academic Center.
