## About
This was my 2016 Science Fair project. The project analyzes certain types of literature that students enjoy reading. More specifically, the project analyzes which genres and sub-genres students prefer, across two variables: age and gender. The project uses the Borda Count Method, a method developed by Jean Charles de Borda, to rank preferences of sub-genres. This project won the Grand Prize at the Worcester Regional Science Fair - 2016, as well as a 2nd prize at the Massachusetts State Science and Engineering Fair - 2016.
