Westborough – For the first time in many years, Westborough High School was represented at the Artistic Discovery Competition sponsored by the Congressional Institute. Of the eight Westborough students who entered the competition, Alexandria Tracchi received first place and Tulika Roy received third place in the photography category.

The submitted photographs were taken during their Digital Photography I, Digital Photography II, and AP Studio Art: 2D Design classes, under the guidance of their teacher Carolyn McGrath. McGrath also helped the students frame their photographs to adhere to the submission guidelines of the competition.

The Artistic Discovery Competition was initiated by the United States Congress in 1982. The goal of this nationwide high school visual arts competition is to recognize and encourage artistic talent across the nation, in each congressional district. Since its inception, more than 650,000 students have participated in the competition. Winners are recognized both in their district, and at an annual awards ceremony in Washington D.C. In addition, one piece of artwork from each congressional district is displayed in the Cannon Tunnel of the U.S. Capitol for one year.

The 2018 Art Competition for the Massachusetts Second Congressional District received 132 art submissions from students throughout the district. These student submissions represented a total of 12 high schools. Two-dimensional works of art from the mediums of painting, drawing, collage, prints, mixed media, and computer-generated art and photographs. These art submissions were judged by a panel of judges, and approximately 30 students received First, Second, Third and Honorable Mention awards. Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA) hosted the winners at an awards ceremony and reception featuring the winning art works. The reception was held at Wachusett Regional High School in Holden April 28.

“Each year since I’ve come to Congress, I’ve been so impressed by the talented young artists from across America who participate in the Congressional Art Competition,” said McGovern. “Their captivating artwork never fails to inspire and delight us here at the Capitol Building, and I am proud to continue to support this wonderful program as it enters its 36th year.”

Said McGrath: “It was an honor to be part of the Congressional Art Competition this year. Jim McGovern and his staff were all very welcoming and friendly, and also very supportive of the arts. I am so proud of all of my students who entered and had artwork on display. Additionally, it was quite exciting to find out that one of my students won first place, and another won third place! It was a wonderful experience from beginning to end, and I am already looking forward to participating again next year.”
