<p>Westborough – On Oct. 20, the <a href="http://westboroughlandtrust.org/">Westborough Community Land Trust (WCLT)</a> held their first Twilight to Moonlight Walk. Janet Anderson, the event organizer, reported that the walk attracted around 60 people from all age groups, from the youngest hikers to seasoned veterans. Even a dog joined along for the hike! Hikers gathered by Lake Chauncy, to witness a beautiful fall sunset before embarking on their hike. The hike was about two miles long and the hikers looped around Lake Chauncy.</p>

<p>The goal of the hike was to explore and experience the natural world at night time, as well as to get in the spirit of Halloween by listening for owl calls. On the walk, the hikers learned about three types of owls that can be found around the Westborough area: the Barred Owl, the Screech Owl, and the Great-Horned Owl.</p>

<p>A few days before the hike, WCLT shared YouTube recordings of the calls of these three owls via social media. Hikers were encouraged to listen to these recordings so that they could be on the lookout for these three types of owls during the walk. Although participants were unable to hear any calls of these owls, they were treated to imitations of them by the youngest hikers. Hikers were also encouraged to bring their own flashlights for the hike. They seldom used the flashlights, however, due to the spectacularly clear skies, and almost full moon. In fact, the skies were so clear, that the hikers were able to spot planet Mars.</p>

<p>A part of the Westborough Community Land Trust’s mission is to educate the public about environmental issues, the wonders of nature, and the importance of preserving and protecting land in the town of Westborough. In support of this mission, the WCLT sponsors events like this on a regular basis. All events are open to the public, and they can be found on WCLT’s calendar, at <a href="http://westboroughlandtrust.org/cal/calendar" title="http://westboroughlandtrust.org/cal/calendar">http://westboroughlandtrust.org/cal/calendar</a>.</p>
